Now you can directly work in your browser!

## Getting started

### Node / JS

> **Note:**
>
> - _There is an **index.js** file located under the \*\*\_src_\*\* folder\_
> - _The **index.js** file, it's already linked with the debugger in your **launch.json**_

To run the **index.js** file:

- with **_node_**, copy and enter one of the following commands on your terminal:

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

  or:

  ```sh
  node src/index.js
  ```

- in development mode that restarts every time you save a file:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

### PlantUML

> **Note:**
>
> - There is a **class.puml** example file located in the **_architecture_** folder.

To start working **_\*.puml_** files:

- You can continue by editing the **class.puml** file
- Add additional **_\*.puml_** files on that folder too.

If you what to visualize a preview of the **class.puml** file or another **_\*.puml_** file on the project, please select the file and on your keyboard press the following keys:

- _MacOS_: **Option + D**

- _Linux/Windows_: **Alt + D**
  The above commands will automatically open your a window and will show you live any updates that you make on the file.

_Now that we are ready, let's have some coding fun!_
